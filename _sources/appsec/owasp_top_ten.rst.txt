OWASP Top 10
============

The OWASP is a well-known and respected organization in the application security sphere. It periodically produces a top vulnerability list, known as the 'OWASP Top 10', which is used extensively throughout the cybersecurity industry.

Broken Access Control
---------------------

Broken access control can take many forms, but at its core, involves an application returning information to an unauthorized user.

Cryptographic Failures
----------------------

Cryptographic failures were known in previous OWASP Top 10 lists as sensitive data exposure. When sensitive data is not subject to appropriate encryption, its theft becomes more accessible for an attacker, which could, in turn, lead to compromised accounts.

Injection
---------

Injection vulnerabilities occur when user-supplied data is used within an application without the implementation of adequate checks. The injection category includes different types of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, command injection, and more.

Insecure Design
---------------

Insecure Design is a new category in the OWASP Top 10 list that covers vulnerabilities created by missing or ineffective controls, which are caused by improper design or implementation.

Security Misconfiguration
-------------------------

Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities occur when threat actors use default accounts, unpatched flaws, or exploit unprotected or unused files and pages to access a system or private information.

Vulnerable and Outdated Components
----------------------------------

Various components are employed on both the client and server side of web applications and software. They're essential for creating and running applications, so it's important to keep them secure and up to date.

Identification and Authentication Failures
------------------------------------------

Identification and authentication failures are common pitfalls for many developers and organizations. When accessing resources, systems, and databases, the identity of every user should be uniquely and correctly validated by the system before access is approved. Failure to do so can have catastrophic effects on all involved, from the business to the end-user.

Software and Data Integrity Failures
------------------------------------

Software and data integrity failures occur when integrity checks are not properly performed. There are multiple types of failures that fit into this category, which have a range of impacts. Many of the recent supply chain compromises would fit into this category.

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
----------------------------------------

An application that doesn't produce logs or implement monitoring would make diagnosing problems difficult. Logs can be critical for incident responders. When there are security logging and monitoring failures, the security of an application drops significantly.

Sever-Side Request Forgery
--------------------------
