OWASP Top 10
============

The OWASP is a well-known and respected organization in the application security sphere. It periodically produces a top vulnerability list, known as the 'OWASP Top 10', which is used extensively throughout the cybersecurity industry.

Broken Access Control
---------------------

Broken access control can take many forms, but at its core, involves an application returning information to an unauthorized user.

Cryptographic Failures
----------------------

Cryptographic failures were known in previous OWASP Top 10 lists as sensitive data exposure. When sensitive data is not subject to appropriate encryption, its theft becomes more accessible for an attacker, which could, in turn, lead to compromised accounts.

Injection
---------

Injection vulnerabilities occur when user-supplied data is used within an application without the implementation of adequate checks. The injection category includes different types of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, command injection, and more.

Insecure Design
---------------

Security Misconfiguration
-------------------------

Vulnerable and Outdated Components
----------------------------------

Identification and Authentication Failures
------------------------------------------

Software and Data Integrity Failures
------------------------------------

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
----------------------------------------

Sever-Side Request Forgery
--------------------------
